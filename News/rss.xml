            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the release of the latest 1.2.x of the board software package for the <em>Quarto</em>, recent versions of the <em>Quarto</em> now support reading and writing to the SD card. All <em>Quarto</em>&#x27;s shipped after in Febuarary 2022 or later fully support the SD card. </p><p>To use the SD card, first in the Arduino IDE, go to Boards Manager and install the latest (1.2.x or higher) version of &quot;qNimble iMXRT Boards by qNimble&quot;</p><img class="center" src="../img/arduino-board-support-1.2.x.png"/><p>Once installed, open the UsageAndBenchmark example under SD,</p><img class="center" src="../img/arduino-example-sd-usage.png"/><p>Then you can put a SD card in the Quarto and run the example to do some basic operations and to benchmark the SD card. Or look at the example code to see how to list files, change directories, read and write files, etc.</p><p>If you aren&#x27;t sure what version of the Quarto you have and if it supports the SD card, open the DeviceInfo example under Testing:</p><img class="center" src="../img/arduino-example-deviceinfo.png"/><p>And when you run it, the output on the Serial Monitor should look something like:</p><pre><code>Quarto Device Information
SN: 516
Device ID: qN-101.3.1
Firmware Revision: 1.26.46
</code></pre><p>If you see a Device ID of qN-101.3.1 or higher, you are ready to use the SD card. If you have qN-101.1.X or qN-101.2.X, please <a href="/Contact">contact <em>qNimble</em></a> about your options for using the SD card with the <em>Quarto</em>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[I'm excited to announce that the Quarto is back in stock! Strong initial sales causes the Quarto to sell out 3 weeks after our product launch. And unfortunately the global chip shortage delayed getting more Quartos made, but they are finally here. And going forward, we will do our best to navigate these supply-chain challenges to keep the Quarto in stock. I want to thank everyone who ordered a Quarto and did not receive it promptly for their patience.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Three weeks ago, we launched the Quarto and a partnered with Vescent who is our exclusive US distributor (press release) and already we have sold out of our initial inventory. This is exciting as early sales were much higher than expected, but unfortunately it means that we cannot ship from stock currently and any new orders will be delayed. We are working to get more *Quartos* made as soon as possible, but given the global chip shortage, this will take longer than we'd like. For the latest update on availability and lead-time, please contact us.]]></description>
